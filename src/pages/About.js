            AmeriBakes was founded with a passion for baking and a mission to spread homemade goodness while giving back to the community. Recognizing that 1 in 10 people in our area face food insecurity, weâ€™re committed to doing our part. Along with sharing our delicious treats, we donate surplus baked goods to local homeless shelters, providing comfort to those in need and fostering connections within our community.

              Hi, I'm Grace, the founder of AmeriBakes. My journey began during the COVID-19 pandemic when baking became a way to bring comfort to my family and friends. With AmeriBakes, I aim to spread that same warmth and joy to everyone. Besides sharing delicious treats, I'm dedicated to giving back to the community. That's why 50% of our proceeds go to non-profits, and we regularly donate treats to homeless shelters.
